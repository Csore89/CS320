Portfolio Reflection
Ensuring Functionality and Security

To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, I rely on rigorous testing and best practices. Writing unit tests, as demonstrated in ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java, allows me to catch errors early and verify that each component works as intended. Additionally, I follow secure coding principles, such as input validation and proper handling of sensitive information, to reduce vulnerabilities. Regular code reviews and using static analysis tools also help identify potential issues before deployment.

Interpreting User Needs

Understanding user needs is a critical step in developing effective software. I approach this by analyzing project requirements, asking clarifying questions, and considering the end-user experience. By translating these needs into specific functional and non-functional requirements, I can incorporate features that meet expectations while maintaining usability, reliability, and performance. Feedback loops, such as testing with sample users or peers, further help ensure that the program aligns with real-world needs.

Designing Software

My approach to software design combines structured planning with iterative development. I start by breaking down the program into modular components, defining clear responsibilities for each class or service. For example, in Project One, Contact.java handles data modeling, while ContactService.java manages operations on contact data. I then create tests to validate each moduleâ€™s behavior, ensuring that the design is both maintainable and scalable. I also prioritize readability, documentation, and adherence to design patterns to make the software easier to extend or modify in the future.
